Overview:
This project simulates the seven layers of the OSI model in Python and demonstrates a file transfer using low-level features (socket and basic file I/O). Each layer (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application) adds its own header to the data.

Files:
- file_transfer_osi.py : Main script for the simulation.
- send_file.txt        : File to be sent (client side).
- INSTRUCTIONS.txt     : This file.

How to Run:
1. Start the Server:
   Open a terminal and run:
      python file_transfer_osi.py server
   (The server listens on 127.0.0.1:5000 and writes data to received_file.txt.)

2. Start the Client:
   Open another terminal, ensure send_file.txt exists, then run:
      python file_transfer_osi.py client
   (The client reads send_file.txt and sends its contents to the server.)
